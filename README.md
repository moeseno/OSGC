# Open Source Gacha Cards!

## What?

Open Source Gacha Cards is cross-platform browser a card game i started developing on Mar 24, 2025. It is mean to be a gacha game that is ethical and does not exploit the player for money, hence why it is open source. In this game you can host your own servers (like in minecraft), which you are the admin of. Players can connect to your server and play on it with others that are on the same server. But this is no normal card game, as it would be way too boring and generic. I plan to make it unique by adding card trading, just like pokemon cards. the amount of cards on a server is decided by the host/admin, so it is a cards are supply (kind of like crypto).

## Why?

I always loved how fun gacha games are, but hated the predatory practices these companies usually use (eg. absurdly priced microtransactions, multiple currencies, annoying popups), so i decided to make my own game mostly inspired by Genshin's TCG and real life trading cards. I originally wanted to find a game that is one time purchase, no time-gating, grindy, pvp, and most importantly, has gacha elements. But after scouring the internet and all available app stores, i found exactly 0 of them that met even half my criteria. I had just thought that there was no demand for such game, but after going on the gachagaming subreddit, i soon discovered multiple posts of people asking if such a game existed, so i decided to make my own. My goal is to eventually (if this even gets any attention), set up a patreon and raise money buy my friend a new laptop, wsince he currently has an intel core i3 with integrated graphics.

## When?

I don't have a release date yet, but i promise i'll be working on it every day.

## Who?

I am a 15 year old teenager living in Hong Kong, as i am currently not going to school right now, i have plenty of free time, and i am basically available at least 14 hrs per day.
